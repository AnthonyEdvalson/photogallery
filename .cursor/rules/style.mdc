When styling components DO NOT:
1. Use border-radius unnecessarily
2. Add glow effects with box-shadow
3. Add colored borders to items
4. Add background colors unnecessarily

This site is pretty minimalist. Use borders sparingly to separate content that is not already obviously separate. E.g. in a grid you do not need borders or shaded backgrounds to each item, the visual layout makes it clear theres a grid and things are speparated.
